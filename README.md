## General Information
Citi Bike is one of the largest bike-sharing program in the United States and have been collecting data on users since 2013 for public access.  In this project, I created visualizations to explore the data, generated dashboards and a report of my findings.  From the years 2019 and 2020, we find that the majority of the riders are male and the busiest riding day is Tuesday.  The peak riding times are around 8am and between 5pm-7pm.  The busiest riding seasons are Spring and Summer.  The most active station is Grove St Path.  

My analysis can be found in the ipynb file titled Analysis.  You can access my Tableau Visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/diane.guzman/viz/CitiBikeProject18/CitiBikeStory
